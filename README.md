# learn_c

these are some mini projects that im making in the c language to get a good feel of the language and programming as a whole


## project types
mainly day to day data structures like 
 
 - a dom (document object model) tree which are used in browsers to represent the state of all the visual and non visual (like templates or elements with a display of none) elements in a particular webpage  (can also be used for xml documents)
- fast look up key value dictionary
- binary search tree (wich can also be used for a key value store although not as fast)
